# **Welcome to Raki's Data Analysis!**

## **Introduction**

I am a hungry person, both for knowledge and food (ðŸ˜†). Consequently, I decided that the most interesting data to analyze would be recipes for delicious dishes. The recipes I analyzed are pulled directly from [food.com](https://www.food.com). Each row in my dataframe contains a recipe, and each column contains useful information about the recipes. Displayed below is information about my dataframe, including the shape and column names.

### Shape of the Recipes Dataframe: 

So what was I actually working with once I cleaned the data and was left with my dataframe ready for analysis?

```py
print(recipes.shape)
```
(234429, 24)

The above result from the code means that there are 234,429 rows and 24 columns in my recipes dataframe!

### Exploratory data analysis (EDA) Question: 

**Which contributors consistently have the highest average recipe ratings?**

This is an important question to think about, because if I am ever super hungry in the future (and also learn how to actually cook), I will know which contributors' recipes to look at. After reading through this EDA, you will also know which contributors are the most esteemed on food.com.

### Which columns were most important to my EDA?

```py
print(recipes.columns.to_list())
```
['name', 'id', 'minutes', 'contributor_id', 'submitted', 'tags', 'n_steps', 'steps', 'description', 'ingredients', 'n_ingredients', 'user_id', 'recipe_id', 'date', 'rating', 'review', 'calories', 'total_fat', 'sugar', 'sodium', 'protein', 'saturated_fat', 'carbohydrates', 'average_rating']

Above is a list of all the column names in the cleaned recipes dataframe that I used for analysis.

The columns that are most related to my EDA were 'contributor_id', 'rating', 'average_rating', and a column I later created called 'num_contributions'.

**contributer_id**: A unique way to identify the contributors (also known as primary key). This column is of type integer.
**'rating'**: A single rating of the recipe given by a user. This column is of type integer.
**'average_rating'**: The mean rating that a recipe was given. This column is of type float.
**'num_contributions'**: The number of contributions a contributor made. This column is of type integer.
